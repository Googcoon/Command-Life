           How To Play Command Life
When you open the game type 1 to start.
*Note* in order to pick a option you have to type the number of the option
Also if you press enter with nothing in it will randomly pick a scene an display it
The game is in early development and is currently a one mand project so if there are bugs email me at lordzboi116@gmail.com
As you also see the game has Beta in its name I can change things in the game and wont be called out for it
Lastly, there are multiple ways to beat the game so if you beat it try to beat it a diffrent way

Thanks for Playing Command Life!
